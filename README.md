# Contact List Model
This is a small Objective-C set of examples (think of it as a playground) that highlight a number of core Objective-C features. Some of which include:

- Core Objective-C (Foundation) data types (NSString, NSArray, NSDictionaries) and some of their mutable counterparts
- Properties
- Lazy initialization of Properties ([ContactList.m](contact-list/ContactList.m), [Person.m](contact-list/Person.m))
- Class Methods, Instance Methods, Accessor Methods
- Blocks ([ContactList.h](contact-list/ContactList.h))
- Categories ([NSString+PhoneFormatting.h](NSString+PhoneFormatting.h))
- Extensions ([Person.m](contact-list/Person.m))

Features to add:

- Protocols
- Weak Properties (by way of a parent child relationship between two classes)
- Some Unit Tests
