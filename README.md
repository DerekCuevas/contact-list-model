# Contact List Model
This is a small Objective-C set of examples (think of it as a playground) that highlight a number of core Objective-C features. Some of which include:

- Core Objective-C (Foundation) data types (NSString, NSArray, NSDictionaries) and some of their mutable counterparts
- Properties
- Lazy initialization of Properties
- Class Methods, Instance Methods, Accessor Methods
- Blocks
- Categories
- Extensions

Features to add:

- Protocols
- Weak Properties (by way of a parent child relationship between two classes)
- Some Unit Tests
