# Contact List Model
This is a small Objective-C set of examples (think of it as a playground) that highlight a number of core Objective-C features, some of which include:

- Core Objective-C (Foundation) data types (NSString, NSArray, and NSDictionary) and some of their mutable counterparts
- Properties
- Lazy Initialization of Properties ([ContactList.m](contact-list/ContactList.m#L19), [Person.m](contact-list/Person.m#L20))
- Class Methods, Instance Methods, Accessor Methods
- Blocks ([ContactList.h](contact-list/ContactList.h#L21))
- Categories ([NSString+PhoneFormatting.h](NSString+PhoneFormatting.h))
- Extensions ([Person.m](contact-list/Person.m#L12))
- And more

Features to add:

- Protocols
- Weak Properties (by way of a parent child relationship between two classes)
- Some Unit Tests
